    <h2>The Simon game</h2>
    <em>A simple simon game</em>
    <p>A JavaScript simon game.</p>
    <img src="img/pro-shots/simongame.png">
    <p>The game is quite simple:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are presented with a random series of button presses</li>
        <br/>

        <li>Each time you input a series of button presses correctly, you see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
        </li>
        <br/>

        <li>You will hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when you personally press a button.</li>
        <br/>
        
        <li>If you press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
        </li>

        <br/>
        <li>You can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
        </li>
        <br/>
        
        <li>If you want to restart, you can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
        </li>
        <br/>
        
        <li>You can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>You can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. you are notified of you victory, then the game starts over.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Enjoy the game!
